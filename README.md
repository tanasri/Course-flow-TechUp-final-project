Final project from techup thailand bootcamp.

CourseFlow. A Next.Js web-application, one-stop online class management system for both admins and users. For admins, they can organize homework distribution, curriculum management, homework grading and tracking, and document filing. Meanwhile, users can see all available class contents and materials, subscribe/unsubscribe classes, turn in their homework/projects, and view their performances.
